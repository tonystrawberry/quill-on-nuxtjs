  A4 Pamphlet Editor
</h1>

## 🖥 Context

I recently came across a A4 pamphlet generator feature inside one web application and wanted to try reverse engineer it. 
I haven't had the opportunity to use NuxtJS up to now so that was a nice and simple introductory project to get me started with it.

## 📚 Libraries
- NuxtJS 3.15.4
- Vue 3
- QuillJS 2.0.3

## 👨🏻‍💻 Local development

1. Install the packages via `npm`.

```
npm install
```

2. Run the server in your local environment.

```
npm run dev -- -o
```

4.  Access the website via localhost.

```
http://localhost:3000/editor
```
